The following is 1st Suricata lab (also did a quick IDS/IPS readthrough)

Your network contains the following machines:

desktop - 192.168.6.1
student:student

firewall - 192.168.6.4, 192.168.10.254
student:student

server - 192.168.10.2
no SSH access

All network traffic from and to the server is routed through the firewall.


==============================
SSH into the firewall

sudo ssh student@firewall

1. INSTALL SURICATA (install it directly from the projectâ€™s official Personal Package Archives repository):
student@firewall~$sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
student@firewall~$sudo apt-get update
student@firewall~$sudo apt-get install suricata

2. Configuring Suricata to listen on enp1s10

Change the listening interface under af-packet: to enp1s10
student@firewall~$grep -in "af-packet:" /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
student@firewall~$vi +580 /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Change IP address range for HOME_NET to 192.168.10.0/24
student@firewall~$grep -in "HOME_NET" /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
student@firewall~$vi +15 /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

3. Restart Suricata
student@firewall~$service suricata restart

4. Monitor and investigate network traffic originating from the server:

119:{"timestamp":"2021-01-10T10:34:56.867303+0000","flow_id":239491005561831,"in_iface":"enp1s10","event_type":"dns","src_ip":"192.168.10.2",
"src_port":34217,"dest_ip":"1.1.1.1","dest_port":53,"proto":"UDP","dns":{"type":"query","id":10045,"rrname":"ues0jibiiz5kes9aphai7quohkeejee5.lab",
"rrtype":"A","tx_id":0}}


What is the malicious domain that is being queried from the server?
ues0jibiiz5kes9aphai7quohkeejee5.lab
