Day 28:

This was the third day of my SCO Core Skills class.  We did the following labs:

Lab 1 Rita:
In this lab we are going to look at detecting command and control traffic on a network.
We will be using Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) for this lab.

We went over the Interval range and Connections.

Some backdoors have a very strong “heartbeat”. This is where a backdoor will constantly reconnect to get commands from an attacker at a specific interval. The interval consistency of the “heartbeat” is the TS score where a value of 1 is perfect. 

We Found :
Src IP : 10.234.234.100
Dest IP: 138.197.117.74
Had interval range of : 8
The TS Duration was was 0.966 (detecting how consistent each connection duration is)
The connections were 4532 

The score was 0.997

Next we looked at : DNSCAT-2017-03-21

Now we see 40799 visits to cat.nanobotninjas.com & nanobotninjas.com
This seems fishy.

Lab 2 Domain Log Review:

In this lab we are going to look at some logs that are generated in a domain password spray attack.  We will start by using DeepBlueCLI, then move into looking directly at the event logs themselves.

We extracted the files into DeepBlue and go to that directory.
C:\ cd C:\tools\DeepBlueCLI-master\
Now we run the Domain Password Spray file.
PS C:\.\DeepBlue.ps1 .\EntLogs\DC2-secLogs-3-26-DomainPasswordSpray.evtx

Log     : Security
EventID : 4672
Message : High number of total logon failures for multiple accounts
Results : Total accounts: 232
          Total logon failures: 240

Command :
Decoded :

240 failures is a lot since it’s not a big organization.
Time to look for a pattern.
	C:\tools\DeepBlueCLI-master\EntLogs\DC2-secLogs-3-26-DomainPasswordSpray
Go to the “DC2-secLogs-3-26-DomainPasswordSpray” in saved logs
Sort by Event ID and look for 4776.
While going through them, the “Logon Account” changes.
Most of them are: 
Source Workstation:	WINLABV2WKSRL-9
These were “Audit Failures”

We now know that the workstation WINLABV2WKSRL-9 was attempting to authenticate to a large number of Logon Accounts.
