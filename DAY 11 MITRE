In this room, we will focus on other projects/research that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created for the cybersecurity community, specifically:

ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
SHIELD (sorry, not a fancy acronym) Active Defense

Unit Tests


============================
	Task 5  Shield Active Defense

Which Shield tactic has the most techniques?
Detect

Is the technique 'Decoy Credentials' listed under the tactic from question #1? (Yay/Nay)
Yay

Explore DTE0011, what is the ID for the use case where a defender can plant artifacts on a system to make it look like a virtual machine to the adversary?
DUC0234

Based on the above use case, what is its ATT&CK® Technique mapping?
T1497

Continuing from the previous question, look at the information for this ATT&CK® Technique, what 2 programs are listed that adversary's will check for?
Sysinternals and Wireshark


============================
	Task 6  ATT&CK® Emulation Plans

How many phases does APT3 Emulation Plan consists of?
3

Under Persistence, what binary was replaced with cmd.exe?
sethc.exe

Examining APT29, what 2 tools were used to execute the first scenario?
pupy and meterpreter

What tool was used to execute the second scenario?
POSHc2

Where can you find step-by-step instructions to execute both scenarios?
ATT&CK Arsenal


============================
	Task 7  ATT&CK® and Threat Intelligence
	
	
	You are a security analyst who works in the aviation sector. Your organization is moving their infrastructure to the cloud. Your goal is to use the ATT&CK® Matrix to 
gather threat intelligence on APT groups who might target this particular sector and use techniques affecting your areas of concern. You are checking to see if there are any 
gaps in coverage. After selecting a group, look over the selected group's information and their tactics, techniques, etc. 


What is a group that targets your sector who has been in operation since at least 2013?
apt33

==========================================
Does this group use Stuxnet? (Yay/Nay)
nay

==========================================
As your organization is migrating to the cloud, is there anything attributed to this APT group that you should focus on? If so, what is it?
Cloud Accounts

==========================================
What tool is associated with this technique?
ruler

==========================================
Per the detection tip, what should you be detecting?
abnormal or malicious behavior

==========================================
What platforms does this affect?
AWS, Azure, Azure AD, GCP, Office 365, SaaS

==============================================================================
