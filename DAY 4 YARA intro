Suricata : YARA Introduction
platform: Rangeforce

Scenario: One day you receive a suspicious email from a "John Smith" with attached files in it. You hesitate to open those files. Fortunately, a friend of yours, who 
does security research, has volunteered to help you out a bit. He states that obviously, these attachments are not meant for opening and execution. He also sends you 
a file with a *.yar file extension and says you can use this to check if the files are malicious. Unfortunately, that is all he had time for as he had some urgent 
business to attend to.

With some quick research you find out that this file can be used with a tool called Yara. You can read and edit the content of the rule file, but without Yara, 
it is no use, so you decide to install it and test it out.

1. Install and Compile YARA
        Update and download dependencies
student@desktop:~$ sudo apt update
student@desktop:~$ sudo apt-get install automake libtool make gcc pkg-config autoconf libssl-dev libmagic-dev
student@desktop:~$ chmod 755 yara-4.0.2.tar.gz 
student@desktop:~$ tar -zxf yara-4.0.2.tar.gz
student@desktop:~$ cd yara-4.0.2
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$./bootstrap.sh
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$./configure --with-crypto --enable-magic
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$make
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$sudo make install
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$sudo ldconfig
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$ make check
         All Passed

2.Yara Rule

         Make a yara rule python script
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$ which python
{your python}
student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$ vi my_first_rule.yar

rule dummy
{
        condition: true
        }


student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$ yara my_first_rule.yar my_first_rule.yar

What is the output after executing the dummy rule on itself?
dummy my_first_rule.yar


3. Yara Options

student@desktop:~/yara-4.0.2$ cd /home/student/Downloads/attachments
        -m is metadata
student@desktop:~/Downloads/attachments$ yara -m yara.yar /home/student/Downloads/attachments/one.pdf
one [description="one.pdf",hash1="d55aa45223606db795d29ab9e341c1c703e5a2e26bd98402779f52b6c2e9da2b"] /home/student/Downloads/attachments/one.pdf

What is the hash value of the one.pdf sample?
d55aa45223606db795d29ab9e341c1c703e5a2e26bd98402779f52b6c2e9da2b

4. Strings Analysis
	-s print matching strings (hexadecimal virtual address:$string identifier:string value)

student@desktop:~/Downloads/attachments$ yara -s yara.yar two.exe
