Early night since I have the SOC Core Skills w/ John Strand tomorrow at 9 am
But here is what I got done on Splunk BOTSv3:

17. According to the Cisco NVM flow logs, for how many seconds does the endpoint generate Monero cryptocurrency? Answer guidance: Round to the nearest second without the unit of measure.		

Theses logs dont appear in sourcetypes (just "cisco:ASA" but if I look up source I find "cisconvmflowdata"

	| metadata type="sources"
	| stats values(source)

We know that Monero was mined with Coinhive, so I will search that term
	
	source="cisconvmflowdata" coinhive

6 events, 
fields "fet" and "fst" look interesting since they are time frames.
I searched the meaning of FST in cicso NVM(source) and find this:
"rename fst as start_time, fet as end_time,"  (https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/emea/docs/2019/pdf/BRKSEC-3446.pdf)

If it is asking for the amount of time it took to generate Monero.
That seems to me that it wants the whole time for the 6 events, 
so I will subtracct the 1st FST from the last FET

	source="cisconvmflowdata" coinhive 
	| reverse

8/20/18
2:05:23.000 PM
fet = Mon Aug 20 14:05:20 2018

8/20/18
1:37:51.000 PM
fst = Mon Aug 20 13:37:34 2018

14:05:20 - 13:37:34 = 00:27:46 = 1666

A: 1666

18	What kind of Splunk visualization was in the first file attachment that Bud emails to Frothly employees to illustrate the coin miner issue? Answer guidance: Two words. (Example: choropleth map)	

From number 5, we know bud is "b-stoll" So I will search that with SMTP

	sourcetype="stream:smtp" sender="bstoll@froth.ly"

11 events

11 events but no subjects looks

I'll try searching "splunk"

	sourcetype="stream:smtp" sender_email="bstoll@froth.ly"   *splunk*

I looked at the contents of the message. and there is a base64 encoded image (2 of them).  I took the first on and decoded it with the site   
https://codebeautify.org/base64-to-image-converter

The first one was a Line Chart but the answer says wrong.
The second one (1 second later) is a Column Chart, which is correct.
I might be missing something but I am going to move on.

19	What IAM user access key generates the most distinct errors when attempting to access IAM resources?	

So I will search IAM users but eliminate successful events. 

	user_type=IAMUser errorCode!="success" 
1040 events, but we need IAM resources.


Now I will create list of the access key and errors
	
	user_type=IAMUser errorCode!="success" 
	| stats dc(errorCode), count by userIdentity.accessKeyId

eventSource has 3 sources:
ec2.amazonaws.com	622	
s3.amazonaws.com	401	
iam.amazonaws.com	17

	user_type=IAMUser errorCode!="success" eventSource="iam.amazonaws.com"
	| stats dc(errorCode), count by userIdentity.accessKeyId

3 IDs all have 1 each:
AKIAIGKL572SFDPOKLHA	1	9
AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA	1	6
ASIAZB6TMXZ7MJUJJK6X	1	2


	user_type=IAMUser errorCode!="success" eventSource="iam.amazonaws.com"
	| stats dc(errorCode), dc(errorMessage), count by userIdentity.accessKeyId
	Back to look at more fileds and I see 2 error codes but 6 error messages,  I'll throw that in the search.

Although AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA has 1 errorCode, that ID has 5 errorMessage.

A: AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA
