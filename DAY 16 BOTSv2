Day 16,  My time spent was working on a question that I am getting wrong on different ways I look at it and I am getting to tired to continue this question.  
So I will leave it for a day I go over the questions that I missed.  But this is what I have.  A lot of regex done today and trying to figure out why it says wrong.
Any help from anyone that did BOTSv2 would be appreciated.

41. The Taedonggang group had several issues exfiltrating data. Determine how many bytes were successfully transferred in their final, mostly successful attempt to exfiltrate files via a method using TCP, using only the data available in Splunk logs. Use 1024 for byte conversion.	

Since this was a TCP-exflitration,  I will look at FTP instead of DNS since the DNS exfiltration normally is UDP.

	sourcetype="stream:ftp"

1490 events.

We are looking for last successful transmissions for I add "successful".

	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful*.
	
1488 events. not much of a change.

I look at one of the "File successfully transferred" events and see loadway="upload". so I add that.

707 events, getting better.

I looked at the most recent and clicked the flow-ID since all the events are single files.
There could be many files in an attampt.
flow_id	= Identifier of a Flow that is unique within an Observation Domain (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StreamApp/7.3.0/DeployStreamApp/FlowProtocols)

494 events

	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful* loadway=Upload flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"


byte per second to second per megabyte = 1,048,576 (https://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/data_transfer_rate/byte_s.html?u=byte_s&v=1)
byte per second to second per kilobyte = 1024 


Now for some regex and creating a table (order by timestamp)

	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful* loadway=Upload flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"
	| rex field=reply_content "(?P<duration>\d+.?\d+) sec.+, (?P<size>.+.?\d+)"
	| table timestamp size duration

There are 494 events. 
Now some regex to get the total of all of the size (in bytes) from flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"
	
	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful* loadway=Upload flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"
	| rex field=reply_content "(?P<duration>\d+.?\d+) sec.+, (?P<size>.+.?\d+) (?P<unit>\w+)bytes"
	| eval unit_speed = case(unit == "M", 1048576, unit == "K", 1024) 
	| eval total=duration*size*unit_speed
	| stats sum(total)

1395020741.07904 

1395020741 and 1395020742 show wrong answer ???

Maybe there are files that are not megabytes or kilobytes.

	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful* loadway=Upload flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"
	| rex field=reply_content "(?P<duration>\d+.?\d+) sec.+, (?P<size>.+.?\d+) (?P<unit>\w+)bytes"
	| eval unit_speed = case(unit == "M", 1048576, unit == "K", 1024) 
	| eval total=duration*size*unit_speed
	| stats count by unit

K	47
M	443
total 490 but 494 events

	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful* loadway=Upload flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"
	| rex field=reply_content "(?P<duration>\d+.?\d+) sec.+, (?P<size>.+.?\d+) (?P<unit>\w+)"
	| table filename unit


What events are missing?
	sourcetype="stream:ftp" *successful* loadway=Upload flow_id="f4703a87-9b70-43d1-af73-344db697a9bf"
	| rex field=reply_content "(?P<duration>\d+.?\d+) sec.+, (?P<size>.+.?\d+) (?P<unit>\w+)bytes"
	| eval unit_speed = case(unit == "M", 1048576, unit == "K", 1024) 
	| eval total=duration*size*unit_speed
	| table filename unit

the following filenames have no unit/transfer rate.

Oktoberfest Ma��rzen WLP820.pdf	 
Ko��lschbier ECY21.pdf	 
Ko��lsch 2565.pdf	 
German Ale Ko��lsch WLP029.pdf
 
"Connecting to port <port number> File successfully transferred"

I can't find the size of the files.

I tried getting the excat time from response time and dividing it by 1000000 to get excat amount of seconds instead of rounded 
(response_time: 528989  reply_content: .... 0.529 seconds (measured here), 442.15 Kbytes per second)

but that didnt work either

I am going to call it a night
