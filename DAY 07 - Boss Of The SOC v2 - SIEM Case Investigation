Day 7
Boss Of The SOC v2 - SIEM Case Investigation
Platform : https://cyberdefenders.org/

I skipped v1 since it looks the same as the one that I did for tryhackme.

In this hands-on exercise, you assume the persona of Alice Bluebird, the analyst who successfully assisted Wayne Enterprises and was recommended to Grace Hoppy at Frothly to assist them with their recent issues.

Hunting Scenarios:

PowerShell: Adversaries will use PowerShell Empire to establish a foothold and carry out attacks.
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP: Data Exfiltration may occur using common network protocols, principally FTP
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - DNS: Data Exfiltration may occur using common network protocols, specifically DNS
Adversary Infrastructure: The adversary has established multiple components of infrastructure beyond what we have already uncovered.
Spearphishing Attachment: Adversaries will attempt to establish a foothold within Froth.ly using Phishing.
User Execution: Adversaries will attempt to establish a foothold within Froth.ly by enticing a user to execute an action on a file.
Persistence - Create Account: An adversary will look to maintain persistence across an enterprise by creating user accounts.
Persistence - Scheduled Task: An adversary will look to maintain persistence across reboots by using a task scheduler.
Indicator Removal On Host: Clearing of audit / event logs could indicate an adversary attempting to cover their tracks.
Reconaissance: User Agent Strings may provide insight into an adversary that they may not have intended to show.
OSINT: Identifying publicly available company information and who is accessing it may provide insight into the adversary.
Lateral Movement: Adversaries will look to move laterally to other systems using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
Data Staging: Adversaries will stage data prior to exfiltration to make it easier to extract data at a time of their choosing as well as have a central place to place information as it is identified.

2. Amber Turing was hoping for Frothly to be acquired by a potential competitor which fell through, but visited their website to find contact information for their executive team. What is the website domain that she visited? Answer guidance: Do not provide the FQDN. Answer example: google.com

First thing I did was search for a user with "amber" in the name

	user=*amber*

I noticed that 10.0.2.101 has the bulk (83%) of src_ip and is the only client_IP, so I'll try that with a sourcetype of http:stream.  Since she was looking for a competeitor's website. It would be a .com so I add that in the search as well.

	src_ip="10.0.2.101" sourcetype="stream:http" site=*.com

77 sites, I glanced through quickly and see 2 potential answer (berkbeer.com and finnegan.com).
Both are just image links but Berk Beer does have ceoberk.png and may have info on the executive team

A: berkbeer.com
===============================================================================================================================	
3. Amber found the executive contact information and sent him an email. What is the CEO's name? Provide the first and last name.

I searched berkbeer from sourcetype="stream:smtp

	sourcetype="stream:smtp" berkbeer

2 berkbeer emails showed up (hbernhard@berkbeer.com and mberk@berkbeer.com).

I searched the earliest email with the content_transfer_encoding printable and the first was this:

Mr. Bernhard,
   I was very sorry to hear about the acquisition falling through. I was ve=
ry excited to work with you in the future. I have to admit, I am a little w=
orried about my future here. I'd love to talk to you about some information=
 I have regarding my work.

Amber Turing
Principal Scientist

	sourcetype="stream:smtp" berkbeer "content_transfer_encoding{}"="quoted-printable" 
	|  reverse
	
His response gave his last name in the email
A: Martin Berk
===============================================================================================================================	
4. After the initial contact with the CEO, Amber contacted another employee at this competitor. What is that employee's email address?

this was found in my research for the last question.

A: hbernhard@berkbeer.com
===============================================================================================================================	
5. What is the name of the file attachment that Amber sent to a contact at the competitor?

I brought up all the berkbeer emails again and found 1 file in attach_filename" field
	
	sourcetype="stream:smtp" berkbeer

A: Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_patent.docx
===============================================================================================================================	
6. What is Amber's personal email address?	

Since the 3 emails that I could read did not have her email,  I checked the encoded one and found her email in the meassage when I decoded with base64decode.org

A: ambersthebest@yeastiebeastie.com
===============================================================================================================================	
7. What version of TOR did Amber install to obfuscate her web browsing? Answer guidance: Numeric with one or more delimiter.

Knowing that its installed one time than used, I simply searched tor.exe

	tor.exe

I then looked at the process_name field and there it was

	
A:7.0.4
===============================================================================================================================	
8. What is the public IPv4 address of the server running www.brewertalk.com?
This one is an easy search

	dest="www.brewertalk.com"

Now I take a look at dest_ip and 2 are there but 1 is private, 
	
A:52.42.208.228
