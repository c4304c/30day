Over what medium has this request been made (linked to the Data Link layer of the OSI model)?
Ethernet II

Which layer of the OSI model does the section that shows the number of bytes transferred (81) link to?
Physical

[Research] Can you figure out what kind of address is shown in the layer linked to the Data Link layer of the OSI model?
MAC

ping bbc.co.uk

Ping muirlandoracle.co.uk

What is the IPv4 address?
217.160.0.152

What switch lets you change the interval of sent ping requests?
-i

What switch would allow you to restrict requests to IPv4?
-4

What switch would give you a more verbose output?
-v

============================================================================================================================================
  TASK 7: Networking Tools Traceroute
Use traceroute on tryhackme.com

Can you see the path your request has taken?
No answer needed

What switch would you use to specify an interface when using Traceroute?
-i

What switch would you use if you wanted to use TCP SYN requests when tracing the route?
-T

[Lateral Thinking] Which layer of the TCP/IP model will traceroute run on by default (Windows)?
Internet

  TASK 9: Networking Tools Dig
What is DNS short for?
Domain Name System

What is the first type of DNS server your computer would query when you search for a domain?
Recursive

What type of DNS server contains records specific to domain extensions (i.e. .com, .co.uk*, etc)*? Use the long version of the name.
Top-Level Domain

Where is the very first place your computer would look to find the IP address of a domain?
Local Cache
